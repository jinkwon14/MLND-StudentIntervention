As F<sub>1</sub> scores indicate, all three models performs well in predicting new data, as more training data are given. However, training time for both Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine(SVM) classifiers increased with as more training data were given. For example, when training set size increased from 100 to 300, training time for both Logistic Regression classifier and SVM classifier tripled. Training time is where we can greatly benefit from Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) classifier; it only calculates the local gradient for finding local minima. \n",

At training set size of 100, SGD classifier returned F<sub>1</sub> score of 0.0004 for traing and 0.0645 for testing. In order to make good predictions at conditions with very limited resources (number of resources under 300), a better alternative should be used.

This also means that the tuned Logistic Regreession model does not perform any better than the untuned model. \n",
    "This can be due to the tuning parameters used introducing negligible difference to the model. The parameters 'penalty' and 'C' are used to solve overfitting. Thus, it is likely that the model was not prone to overfitting even when it was trained with default parameters. 'Random_state', which shuffles the data randomly, also did not introduce noticable difference because, possibly, the testing data was not complex enough for shuffling to make significant improvements."
